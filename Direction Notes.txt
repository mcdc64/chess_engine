To add: 
- Flesh out GUI, add turn counter and move history.
- Last week, designed a system to import FEN strings. Must now come up with a system of generating FEN strings from a given board (this will make it possible to replay games). Add arrow buttons to go back to previous boards.
- Come up with a way to tell which moves are legal, given the starting board and the move requested. Can break this down into more specific checks:
	1. Is the piece in question able to move that way?
	2. Is another piece sitting in the way from the starting square to the target?
	3. Upon moving, is your king left in check (either because it was in check initially, or because your move
	put it there)?

- Must iterate over all pieces of the current moving colour to get all legal moves. This will be sufficient, for example, to tell when checkmate/stalemate have occurred. Also an important intermediate step in programming an engine to play against.
